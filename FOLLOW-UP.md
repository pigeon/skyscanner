# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the app? What are they used for?

I have used library called [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) The library is used to download and cache airline logos. I used it before in few pet projects and mosly used it because it is literally drag&drop solution.

# General:

### Q) How long did you spend on the test?

Difficult to say. I was mostly working on the task during my commute and some evenings. I'd say ~16-18 hours in total would be about right.

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I'd add more tests for the part where json is getting mapped to the objects that get used by UI. I'd probably try different approaches for impleminthing the main table cell view.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I wouldn't say something was particulary difficult it all comes down to the time you can spend for the task. JSON -> PONSO
mapping is not difficult but is quite laborious task which I would rather give to some code generator.

It took me some time and required googling to get details/export things from Sketch. I have been using Zeppelin & Figma for the
last few years 


### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.
